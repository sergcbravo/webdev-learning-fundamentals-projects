# WebDev Learning Fundamentals Projects

Welcome to my repository of web development projects, a chronicle of my journey through the intricacies of web technologies. Here, you'll find a collection of small, focused projects, each exploring different aspects of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Projects Overview

### 10sec Countdown Timer
A simple yet functional countdown timer that serves as an exercise in precision and DOM manipulation. It demonstrates the basic use of JavaScript timers and dynamic HTML content updates.
